	The work in this thesis is based on research carried out in the Department of
	Physics at Durham University (UK), as well as in the Department of Physics at the University of Turin (Italy). No part of this thesis has been submitted elsewhere for any degree or qualification. This thesis is based on joint research: Chapter~\ref{sec:Hbb} is based on Ref.~\cite{Badger:2021ega}, Chapter~\ref{sec:Wyj} on Ref.~\cite{Badger:2022ncb} and Chapter~\ref{sec:QEDpaper} on Ref.~\cite{Badger:2023xtl}.

\begin{acknowledgements*}
%
	Most of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Simon Badger, for his continuous guidance over the last couple of years, stretching back to our time in Durham. Without his keen help, the course of my PhD would have been much rougher.
 
    I am indebted to my collaborators: Simone Zoia, Bayu Hartanto, Ryan Moodie and Francesco Sarandrea, for patiently answering my endless and extremely specific questions, as well as for providing occasional IT support.
    
    Finally, I thank my fellow PhD students in Torino for making my time there enjoyable and for tirelessly explaining convoluted concepts of Italian grammar.
    
    I wish all a fruitful and happy future (and no sign mistakes when permuting $\tr_5$).
