\section{QED} \label{sec:QEDintro}
The central equation of quantum field theory which describes all spin\=/1/2 particles is the Dirac equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Dirac}
    (\slashed{p}-m)\psi(x) = 0\,.
\end{equation}
The solutions to this equation are given by the four-component Dirac spinors $\psi(x)$, which transform in the irreducible $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \otimes \left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ representation\footnote{Not to be confused with the usual four-vectors $x^\mu$, which transform in the $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ representation.}. There are four plane-wave solutions to the Dirac equation, which admit both positive and negative energies:
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x) = u^s(p)\ex{-\i p\cdot x} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \psi(x) = v^s(p)\ex{+\i p\cdot x}\,,
\end{equation}
where $s=\{+, -\}$ labels the spin of the fermion. The momentum space spinors $u(p)$ and $v(p)$ are interpreted as describing particles and antiparticles with \textit{positive} energies, respectively. They satisfy the momentum space Dirac equations: 
\begin{align}
    (\slashed{p} - m)u(p) &= 0\,, \\
    (\slashed{p} + m)v(p) &= 0\,,
\end{align}
as well as the following completeness relations, which is useful when performing spin sums in amplitude computations:
\begin{align} \label{eq:completeness:fermions}
    \sum_{s=\pm} u^s(p)\bar{u}^s(p) &= \slashed{p} + m\,, \\
    \sum_{s=\pm} v^s(p)\bar{v}^s(p) &= \slashed{p} - m\,.
\end{align}
Moreover, it is convenient to split the spinors into two separate components:
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x) = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \psi_L(x) \\
        \psi_R(x)
    \end{pmatrix}\,,
\end{equation}
where the left- and right-handed Weyl spinors transform under the $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0 \right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0 \right)$ representations, respectively. Crucially, in the absence of mass, the two components fully decouple \JK{maybe a better word?}. It is also useful to define an additional $\gamma^5$ matrix (also known as the chirality operator): 
\begin{equation}
    \gamma^5 \equiv \i \gamma^0 \gamma^1 \gamma^2 \gamma^3\,,
\end{equation}
which in the Weyl (chiral) representation of the $\gamma$-matrices is just:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma^5 = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}
Then, the Weyl spinors can be extracted from the Dirac spinors by applying appropriate projectors, according to $\psi_L(x) = P_L\psi(x)$ and $\psi_R(x) = P_R\psi(x)$:
\begin{equation}
    P_L = \frac{1-\gamma^5}{2} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}\,,
    \qquad
    P_R = \frac{1+\gamma^5}{2} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}
Finally, we can associate $\psi_L$ and $\psi_R$ with the \textbf{helicity} of a particle, which is the projection of its spin onto the direction of motion. The corresponding helicity values for left- and right-handed particles are $-1$ and $+1$, respectively\footnote{Strictly speaking, the left- and right-handed Weyl spinors are eigenstates of the chirality operator $\gamma^5$. However, for $m=0$, helicity and chirality eigenstates coincide}.
Weyl spinors will play a key role in the discussion of the spinor-helicity formalism in Section~\ref{sec:spinhelform}.

\section{Quantum Chromodynamics} \label{sec:QCD}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:liealgebra}
    [T^{a_1}, T^{a_2}] = \i f^{a_1a_2a_3} T^{a_3} \,.
\end{equation}
Working in the fundamental representation with normalisation $\tr(T^{a_1} T^{a_2}) = \mathrm{T}_F \, \delta^{a_1a_2}$, we multiply both sides by $T^{a_3}$ and take the trace:
\begin{align} \label{eq:f(abc)}
    \tr(T^{a_3}[T^{a_1}, T^{a_2}]) &= \i f^{a_1a_2a_4} \tr(T^{a_3} T^{a_4}) \nonumber \\
    \tr(T^{a_3} T^{a_1} T^{a_2} - T^{a_3} T^{a_2} T^{a_1}) &= if^{a_1a_2a_4} \mathrm{T}_F \delta^{a_3a_4} \nonumber \\ 
    \implies f^{a_1a_2a_3} &= -\frac{\i}{\mathrm{T}_F} \tr(T^{a_3} T^{a_1} T^{a_2} - T^{a_3} T^{a_2} T^{a_1}) \nonumber \\
    &= -\frac{\i}{\mathrm{T}_F} \tr(T^{a_1} T^{a_2} T^{a_3} - T^{a_1}T^{a_3} T^{a_2}) \,.
\end{align}

Completeness relations for the spin-1 polarisation vectors:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:completeness:bosons}
    \sum_{s=\pm} \varepsilon_\mu^s(p, q) (\varepsilon_\nu^s(p, q))^{\ast} = -g_{\mu\nu} + \frac{p_\mu q_\nu + p_\nu q_\mu}{p \cdot q}
\end{equation}
\JK{is this true only in the axial gauge? See Eq. 30 of `Calculating scattering amplitudes efficiently'. We don't use the axial gauge.}

\section{Particle scattering} \label{sec:particlescattering}
Having introduced the quantum field theories that describe the most fundamental particles our nature has to offer, one might rightfully wonder about the rewards for our intellectual effort (beyond personal satisfaction). After all, amongst our non-physicist friends, it is common to think that the word `theoretical' in theoretical physics is synonymous with `hypothetical'. Not much could be further from the truth and we dedicate this section to illustrating the immense predictive power of QFTs.

Consider a typical particle physics experiment. Two beams of particles, travelling in opposite direction, interact briefly and produce a host of new states that fly away in various directions until they are registered by some kind of a detector. Naturally, the number of such scattering events is proportional to the number of particles in the two beams, $N_a$ and $N_b$, as well as to the area common to the beams, $A$. The ratio of these quantities is known as the scattering \textbf{cross-section}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:crossection}
    \sigma \equiv \frac{\text{number of scattering events}}{N_a N_b A}\,.
\end{equation}
Typically, apart from just counting the total number of events, we want to differentiate between the type of outgoing particles, their momentum, angle of collision, etc. However, if we specify an exact value for a continuous variable such as the momentum, the numerator of Eq.~\ref{eq:crossection} becomes infinitesimal. To avoid this issue, we usually work with a \textit{differential} cross-section, e.g. $\dd\sigma/(\dd p_1 \ldots \dd p_n)$, such that its integral over some small range of $p_i$ gives the \textit{total} cross-section in that region of momentum space. While cross-sections can be measured in particle colliders, it is the task of QFT to make predictions for them.

In the case of hadron collisions, there is one additional complication which is not present in the relatively `clean' world of QED interactions. The fundamental objects of QCD are quark and gluons, however they cannot be observed individually due to colour confinement --- only colourless combinations can be scattered and subsequently detected in a collider. The LHC, being (primarily) a proton-proton collider, requires a more complicated model of the interactions than just the scattering of point particles. Now, recall from Eq.~\ref{eq:QCDbetafunction} that QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom. The coupling $\alpha_s$ decreases with energy (i.e. at small distances) and its value determines whether we are allowed to use perturbation theory or not. Roughly speaking, above the scale $\Lambda_\text{QCD} \sim 200 \text{ GeV}$, $\alpha_s$ becomes small enough such that the perturbative expansion is justified. The individual `partons' (i.e. quarks, antiquarks and gluons) act like free particles and undergo `hard' scattering\cite{PhysRevLett.23.1415} described by the \textit{partonic} cross-section $\hat{\sigma}$. On the other hand, physics at energies below $\Lambda_\text{QCD}$ is necessarily non-perturbative due to large $\alpha_s$ values. Its effects are captured by the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) $f_i(x, \mu_F)$, which give the probability of finding in a hadron a given parton $i$ with momentum fraction $x$ of this hadron\JK{Is this sentence grammatically correct?.}. Here, $\mu_F$ is 

%Scaling with $\mu_F$ - DGLAP equations.
%PDFs are renormalised
%The PDFs are extracted from experimental data. List PDF sets
%Factorisation formula - include the $\order{\frac{\Lambda_\text{QCD}}{Q}}$ terms - see Schwartz p.685
\begin{equation}
    \dd \sigma = \sum \int PDF \dd \hat{\sigma} + \order{\frac{\Lambda_\text{QCD}}{Q}}
\end{equation}
%This phenomenological approach assumes factorisation: that PDFs are universal objects, and any scattering process involving protons can be computed using the same PDFs with a different perturbative calculation. It is remarkable that this procedure works so well, and it is therefore desirable to have a precise derivation of factorisation.

% Parton showers, jets, hadronisation
%insert a picture showing factorisation and then parton showers etc.

We remark that the computation of each element described in this section, i.e. the cross-sections, the PDFs, the Monte Carlo phase-space integration, parton showers, hadronisation and jets, is a tremendous effort undertaken by thousands of particle physicists around the world. This thesis is a small building block of the entire enterprise and aims to shed light on just one of these aspects --- the calculation of scattering amplitudes.

\section{Scattering amplitudes}
Having decoupled the high and low energy physics within a hadron, let us now address the computation of the hard scattering between partons. The partonic cross section $\hat{\sigma}$ is calculated by considering the matrix elements of asymptotic states. Very schematically,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\sigma} \propto \,_{\text{as.}}\braket{\text{final}|\text{initial}}_{\text{as.}}
\end{equation}

\section{Divergences}
The dimensionally regulated Feynman diagrams satisfy the following properties~\cite{Wilson1973}:
\begin{itemize}
\begin{subequations}
    \item Linearity:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:linearity}
        \int \dd^d k\, \left[ a f_1(k) + b f_2(k) \right] = a \int \dd^d k\, f_1(k) + b \int \dd^d k\, f_2(k)\,,
    \end{equation}
    where $a, b$ are arbitrary constants.
    \item Translational invariance:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:translationalinvariance}
        \int \dd^d k\, f(k+q) = \int \dd^d k\, f(k)\,,
    \end{equation}
    where $q$ is an arbitrary vector that can depend on the external momenta $p$, as well as the loop momenta $k$ (or both).
    \item Scaling:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:scaling}
        \int \dd^d k\, f(\lambda k) = \lambda^{-d} \int \dd^d k\, f(k)\,,
    \end{equation}
    where $\lambda$ is an arbitrary positive constant.
\end{subequations}
\end{itemize}
