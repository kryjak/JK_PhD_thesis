\chapter{Tools for calculating scattering amplitudes}
In this chapter, we focus on various aspects of the computation of two-loop QCD scattering amplitudes for high-multiplicity processes. It is important to note that there is currently no one-size-fits-all approach that would allow us to compute all the desired amplitudes at a press of a button. In practice, we use a collection of methods that are most appropriate for the task at hand. For processes at the limit of current capabilities, these tools need to be further improved or replaced with novel ideas. To this end, much work has been done by the theory community in recent years. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming algebraic and analytic complexity, many calculations still present challenges beyond the reach of current technology.

The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the method we adopt in amplitude computations, as well as the problems that invariably follow. The procedure involves several highly non-trivial steps. To help the reader retain the `big picture' of the workflow, we present its schematic outline in Fig.~\ref{fig:outline}.  Each step is discussed in more detail below. 

\section{Feynman diagrams}
The starting point of our amplitude computation for a given process is the generation of all Feynman diagrams contributing to this process at the desired loop order. Feynman diagrams provide a pictorial representation of the ways in which the interaction can occur.
%time-ordered correlation functions that contribute to the $S$-matrix element
At the same time, the corresponding mathematical expressions can be easily recovered using Feynman rules, which can be derived form the Lagrangian of the theory under consideration \JK{(Feynman rules relevant to our work are listed in Appendix~\ref{app:feynmanrules})}. As such, these diagrams are an indispensable tool of any perturbative calculation. In practice, it can be observed that usually their number grows faster than exponentially as we increase the loop order or multiplicity (see Table~\ref{tab:ndiags} for an example). To handle the combinatorial complexity, we generate the relevant Feynman diagrams using $\texttt{QGRAF}$~\cite{Nogueira:1991ex}. This programme has the advantage of granting the user a large degree of control over the diagrams. For example, one can constrain it to generate diagrams without self-energy insertions or with a specified total power of the coupling constant. \JK{should I even mention that?}

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}

\end{table}

\section{Colour decomposition}
Having generated the Feynman diagrams, we substitute the Feynman rules for the propagators and vertices using \texttt{Mathematica}. At this point, our QCD amplitude contains both colour and kinematic information. The idea of colour ordering is to reorganise the amplitude such that these two components separate: a purely kinematic amplitude is multiplied by the corresponding colour factor. In other words, we perform the decomposition of the full amplitude in colour space, according to a chosen colour basis. Roughly speaking:
\begin{equation}
    \ampl{n}{} = \sum_i \text{(colour)}_i \times A_{n\,i} \,, 
\end{equation}
where $A_{n\,i}$ are the colour-ordered amplitudes (also known as colour-stripped or partial amplitudes). The motivation behind this decomposition is that the colour-ordered amplitudes turn out to be significantly simpler to calculate.

The choice of the colour basis is not unique. We adopt the decomposition according to traces of the $SU(N_c)$ generators in the fundamental representation. As an example, let's look at the 4-gluon scattering at tree-level:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3grule}
\feynmandiagram [baseline = (i.base), horizontal = i to j] {
    a1 [particle={$A^{a_1}_{\mu_1}$}] -- [gluon, momentum=$p_1$] i;
    a2 [particle={$A^{a_2}_{\mu_2}$}] -- [gluon, momentum=$p_2$] i;
    i -- [gluon] j;
    a3 [particle={$A^{a_3}_{\mu_3}$}] -- [gluon, momentum=$p_3$] j;
    a4 [particle={$A^{a_4}_{\mu_4}$}] -- [gluon, momentum=$p_4$] j;
    };
    \xrightarrow{colour}
    f^{a_1a_2b}f^{ba_3a_4} \,.
\end{equation}
The colour factor of this diagram can be expressed in terms of the generators using Eqs.~\ref{eq:liealgebra} and ~\ref{eq:fierz}:
\begin{equation}
    f^{a_1a_2b}f^{ba_3a_4} = -\frac{1}{T_F}\left(\tr[T^{a_1} T^{a_2} T^{a_3} T^{a_4}] - \tr[T^{a_1} T^{a_2} T^{a_4} T^{a_3}] - \tr[T^{a_1} T^{a_3} T^{a_4} T^{a_2}] + \tr[T^{a_1} T^{a_4} T^{a_3} T^{a_3}] \right)\,.
\end{equation}
The colour factors of the $t$- and $u$-channels can be expressed in a similar way. Combining the contributions from the three channels and using the cyclicity of the trace, we can organise the 4-gluon amplitude at tree-level as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \ampl{4}{(0)} =  g^2 \left( \tr[T^{a_1} T^{a_2} T^{a_3} T^{a_4}]\,A_{4}^{(0)}[1234] + \text{permutations of } (234) \right) \,.
\end{equation}
In the general case, this formula reads:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:colour-decomposition}
    \ampl{n}{(0)} = g^{n-2} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{n-1}} \tr\left[T^{a_1} T^{\sigma(a_2} \ldots T^{a_n)}\right] A_n^{(0)} \left[1\,\sigma(2\ldots n)\right] \, ,
\end{equation}
where the sum is over the set of all \textit{non-cyclic} permutations of $n-1$ particles. Similar colour decompositions can be derived for amplitudes involving quarks, as well as beyond tree-level~\cite{Dixon:1996wi}. At loop-level, the colour basis contains products of traces, in addition to single trace structures. 

The colour-ordered amplitudes are calculated by adding up the kinematic parts of all Feynman diagrams contributing to a given colour factor. They are gauge invariant and satisfy a number of important identities:
\begin{align}
    A_n[123\ldots n] &= A_n[23\ldots n\,1]\,, && \text{cyclicity} \\
    A_n[123\ldots n] &= (-1)^n A_n[n \ldots 231] \,, && \text{reflection} \\
    A_n[123 \ldots n] &+ A_n[213 \ldots n] +  A_n[231 \ldots n] +  \ldots + && A_n[23 \ldots 1\,n]  = 0 \,, \nonumber \\ 
    & && U(1) \text{ decoupling} \\
    A_n[1, {\alpha}, n, {\beta}] &= (-1)^{|\beta|} \sum_{\mathclap{\sigma \in OP(\{\alpha\} \cup \{\beta^T\})}} A_n[1, \sigma, n] \,, && \text{Kleiss-Kuiff relations}
\end{align}
\JK{fix alignment!!!} where the sum is over permutations in the joint set $\{\alpha\} \cup \{\beta^T\}$ such that the order within the individual sets is preserved, and $\{\beta^T\}$ is the reversal of the set $\{\beta\}$~\cite{Mangano:1990by, Kleiss:1989616, Bern:2008qj}. Crucially, these properties allow us to reduce the number of independent amplitudes that need to be computed. In fact, for $n$-gluon scattering, this number is just $(n-2)!$\,.

\section{Helicity amplitudes}
After colour decomposition, our $L$-loop scattering amplitude contains purely kinematic information. The kinematic part of the Feynman rules for external states carries information about the spins and polarisations of particles: for massless spin\=/1/2 fermions, we use $\pm$ helicity states to differentiate between the two solutions to the Dirac equation, while for massless spin\=/1 bosons, they denote the two polarisation vectors. From the experimental perspective, we are rarely interested in differentiating between the spin states of individual particles. Usually, a beam of particles with random spins undergoes scattering and we look at the total number of particles outgoing in a certain direction. Thus, to calculate the corresponding cross-section, we should average over the initial spin states and sum over the final ones. This can be achieved in two different ways: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item perform the amplitude calculation without specifying the helicity states, i.e. square the amplitude, then do the spin sums that appear at the level of $|\ampl{}{}|^2$ using completeness relations Eqs.~\ref{eq:completeness:fermionsm, eq:completeness:bosons}
    \item specify the helicity states of external particles, compute each \textbf{helicity amplitude} separately, square them and sum over all relevant helicity configurations
\end{enumerate}
In our computations, we will adopt the latter method. We denote an $L$-loop helicity amplitude as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:helampdef}
    \ampl{n}{(L),\,\{h\}} \equiv \ampl{n}{(L)}(1^{h_1}2^{h_2} \ldots n^{h_n})\,,
\end{equation}
where the superscript $\{h\}$ is understood as the set of helicities of the $n$ particles, but will be usually omitted since we will exclusively compute helicity amplitudes. The full, spin-summed amplitude can then be recovered through:
\begin{equation}
    \ampl{n}{(L)} = \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{helicity} \\ \text{configurations}}}} \ampl{n}{(L),\,\{h\}} \,.
\end{equation}
At the cross-section level:
\begin{equation}
    \left|\ampl{n}{(L)}\right|^2 = \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{helicity} \\ \text{configurations}}}} \left|\ampl{n}{(L),\,\{h\}} \right|^2 \,.
\end{equation}
It is important to note that the sum only includes the squares of individual helicity amplitudes --- there are no interferences between different helicity configurations.

There are several strong advantages to this approach. Firstly, it is easy to see that the number of terms that need to be processed is significantly smaller than in method~(1) \JK{check with SB if the argument below even makes sense...}. Consider the expansion of an amplitude in the coupling constant $\alpha$ up to NNLO:
\begin{equation}
    \ampl{}{} = \ampl{}{(0)} + \alpha \ampl{}{(1)} + \alpha^2 \ampl{}{(2)} + \order{\alpha^3} \,.
\end{equation}
Then, at the level of the cross-section, we have the following contributions:
\begin{equation}
    |\ampl{}{}|^2 = |\ampl{}{(0)}|^2 \,+\,\alpha\,2\,\mathrm{Re}\left(\ampl{}{(0)\ast}\ampl{}{(1)}\right) \,+\, \alpha^2 \left(2\,\mathrm{Re} \left(\ampl{}{(0)\ast}\ampl{}{(2)}\right) + |\ampl{}{(1)}|^2 \right) \,+\, \order{\alpha^3}\,.
\end{equation}
Let us also schematically write each $L$-loop amplitude as a sum of $m_L$ Feynman diagrams: $\ampl{}{(L)} = d^{(L)}_1 + d^{(L)}_2 + \ldots + d^{(L)}_{m_L}$. Then, at LO:
\begin{equation}
    \left|\ampl{n}{(0)}\right|^2 = \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{hel.} \\ \text{confs.}}}} \left|\ampl{n}{(0),\,\{h\}} \right|^2 = \sum_{\mathclap{\substack{\text{hel.} \\ \text{confs.}}}} \left|d^{(0)\,,\{h\}}_1 + d^{(0)\,,\{h\}}_2 + \ldots + d^{(0)\,,\{h\}}_{m_0} \right|^2 \,.
\end{equation}
Each term in this sum has all helicities fixed and there are no spin sums to be performed (when evaluated at a chosen phase-space point, it is just a complex number). Thus, the number of terms we need to process at LO is $m_0 n_h$, where $n_h$ is the number of independent helicity configurations. On the other hand, according to method (1), we have:
\begin{equation}
    \left|\ampl{n}{(0)}\right|^2 = \left(d^{(0)}_1 + d^{(0)}_2 + \ldots + d^{(0)}_{m_0} \right) \left(d^{(0)\ast}_1 + d^{(0)\ast}_2 + \ldots + d^{(0)\ast}_{m_0} \right)\,,
\end{equation}
which means we need to interfere the diagrams with each other and perform the spin sums. Thus, there are $m_0^2$ terms to be processed. The scaling for higher loop orders is listed in Table~\ref{tab:nterms}. For small $L$, the advantage of using helicity amplitudes might be minimal (or in fact, it might be detrimental to do so). For $L\geq2$, however, the advantage becomes apparent, especially that due to the symmetries of colour-ordered amplitudes, $n_h$ is usually much smaller than $2^n$. Moreover, it turns out that not all helicity amplitudes are equally challenging to compute, as we will see in the next section. In fact, a host of them vanishes altogether (at least at tree-level). Finally, guided by experience, it is possible to choose the reference vectors of external polarisations such that the computation of non-zero amplitudes becomes easier.

\section{Spinor helicity formalism} \label{sec:spinhelform}
In Section~\ref{sec:QEDintro}, we saw that for massless particles, the Dirac spinor splits into two Weyl spinors that do not mix and are associated with the helicity of the particle. Therefore, we might be tempted to think that helicity amplitudes are better described using a notation specific to the two-component Weyl spinors, which are acted on by the familiar Pauli matrices. Indeed, the powerful \textbf{spinor-helicity formalism} provides a neat way to express helicity amplitudes based on these considerations.

As a first step, let's see how we can move from working with the four-component objects to two-component ones. We can write a `slashed' momentum $\slashed{p}$ as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pslashed}
    \slashed{p} = p_\mu \gamma^\mu = p_\mu
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & (\sigma^\mu)_{a\dot{b}} \\
    (\bar{\sigma}^\mu)^{\dot{a}b} & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \equiv
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & p_{a\dot{b}} \\
    p^{\dot{a}b} & 0 
    \end{pmatrix} \, ,
\end{equation}
with both dotted and un-dotted indices running over $\{1,2\}$ and $(\sigma^\mu)_{a\dot{b}} \equiv (1, \, \sigma^i), \, (\bar{\sigma}^\mu)^{\dot{a}b} \equiv (1, \, -\sigma^i)$, where $\sigma^i$ are the three Pauli matrices. The momentum bispinors $p^{\dot{a}b}$ and $p_{a\dot{b}}$ can be thought of as $(2 \times 2)$ matrices and it is straightforward to show that:
\begin{equation}
    \det p_{a\dot{b}} = \det p^{\dot{a}b} = m^2\,.
\end{equation}
For massless particles, this determinant vanishes and the matrix can be expressed as an outer product of two vectors\footnote{The determinant of a matrix is 0 only if its column/row vectors are linearly dependent, which implies that its rank is 1. A rank-1, $(n \times n)$ matrix can always be expressed as the outer product of two nonzero vectors of length $n$.}. The vectors we will choose are the momentum space Weyl spinors $\lambda_a$  and $\tilde{\lambda}_{\dot{a}}$ (sometimes referred to as helicity spinors). They are the two-component, left- and right-handed equivalents of the $u(p)$ and $v(p)$ Dirac spinors, with the corresponding helicities $-$ and $+$, respectively. We thus write:
\begin{align} \label{eq:outerproduct}
    p_{a\dot{b}} = \lambda_a \tilde{\lambda}_{\dot{b}} && p^{\dot{a}b} = \tilde{\lambda}^{\dot{a}} \lambda^b\,,
\end{align}
and the raising and lowering of indices is achieved through:
\begin{align}
    \lambda^a = \varepsilon^{ab} \lambda_b && \tilde{\lambda}^{\dot{a}} = \varepsilon^{\dot{a}\dot{b}} \lambda_{\dot{b}} \,,
\end{align}
with the two-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon^{ab} = \varepsilon^{\dot{a}\dot{b}} = -\varepsilon_{ab} = -\varepsilon_{\dot{a}\dot{b}} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        -1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}
In practice, it can be rather cumbersome to keep track of the dotted and un-dotted indices, as well as their lower or upper positions at the spinors. It is more intuitive to trade this notation for spinor brackets\footnote{The choice of assignment of dotted/un-dotted indices and angle/square brackets to either $\lambda$ or $\tilde{\lambda}$ is arbitrary. Different conventions are seen throughout literature - the only requirement is internal consistency.}:
\begin{align} \label{eq:lambdatobraket}
    \lambda_a  &\rightarrow \ketsq{p}_a,  &&\tilde{\lambda}_{\dot{a}} \rightarrow \bra{p}_{\dot{a}}\,, \nonumber \\
    \lambda^a  &\rightarrow \brasq{p}^a  &&\tilde{\lambda}^{\dot{a}} \rightarrow \ket{p}^{\dot{a}} \,.
\end{align}
We can then write Eq.~\ref{eq:pslashed} as:
\begin{align}
    \slashed{p} = \ket{p}\brasq{p} && \slashed{p} = \ketsq{p} \bra{p} \,,
\end{align}
while the massless Dirac equation becomes the massless Weyl equation:
\begin{align} \label{eq:weyleq}
    \slashed{p}\ket{p} = 0 && \slashed{p}\ket{p} = 0\,.
\end{align}
In the above, $\slashed{p}$ is a small abuse of the `slashed' notation --- what it really means is a contraction of $p_\mu$ with $\sigma^\mu$ or $\bar{\sigma}^\mu$, rather than $\gamma^\mu$. The appropriate Lorentz vector can be chosen by looking at the indices of the square/angle spinors that $p^\mu$ is sandwiched between. However, the power of spinor-helicity formalism lies in the fact that in practice, we do not ever need to perform such explicit summation over indices and instead work with identities at the level of angle and square brackets:
\begin{align}
    \braket{ij} \equiv \bra{i}_{\dot{a}} \ket{j}^{\dot{a}}&& \braketsq{ij} \equiv \brasq{i}^a \ketsq{j}_a \,.     
\end{align}
It is straightforward to show that because the indices are raised and lowered using the Levi-Civita symbol, these brackets must be \textit{antisymmetric}:
\begin{align}
    \braket{ij} = -\braket{ji} && \braketsq{ij} = -\braketsq{ji}\,.
\end{align}
We can also formulate angle-square or square-angle brackets as follows:
\begin{align}
    \langle ikj ] \equiv \bra{i} \slashed{k} \ketsq{j} && [ikj\rangle \equiv \brasq{i} \slashed{k} \ket{j}\,.
\end{align}
To choose the right $\slashed{k}$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:pslashed}, we just need to remember that $\langle ik] = [ik\rangle = 0$. These brackets can be extended to arbitrary lengths by inserting additional slashed momenta inside. 

We note some very useful identities\footnote{Naturally, the Schouten and Fierz identities also hold if we exchange all angle and square brackets. Wherever $\gamma^\mu$ appears, it is understood as either $\sigma^\mu$ or $\bar{\sigma}^\mu$, as explained earlier.}:
\begin{align}
    \braket{ii} = \braketsq{ii} = 0 && \text{by antisymmetry} \label{eq:iieq0} \\
    s_{ij} = -\braket{ij}\braketsq{ij} && \text{(for massless momenta)} \\
    \braketsq{ij}^{\ast} = \braket{ji} && \text{(for real momenta)} \label{eq:complexconjbracket} \\
    \sum_{i=1}^n \ketsq{i}\bra{i} = \sum_{i=1}^n \ket{i}\brasq{i} = 0 && \text{momentum conservation} \label{eq:spinmomcons}\\
    \ket{i}\braket{jk} + \ket{j}\braket{ki} + \ket{k}\braket{ij} = 0 && \text{Schouten identity} \label{eq:schouten} \\
    \brasq{i}\gamma^\mu \ket{j} = \bra{j} \gamma^\mu \ketsq{k} && \\
    \brasq{i}\gamma^\mu \ket{j}^{\ast} = \brasq{j}\gamma^\mu \ket{i} && \text{(for real momenta)} \\
    \brasq{i}\gamma^\mu \ket{j} \brasq{k}\gamma_\mu \ket{l} = 2\braketsq{ik}\braket{jl} && \text{Fierz identity} \label{eq:fierz} \,.
\end{align}

In addition to massless fermions, we need to be able to write the polarisation vectors of massless spin\=/1 bosons in the spinor-helicity language. In analogy to Eq.~\ref{eq:outerproduct}, the Coulomb gauge identity $\epsilon_{\pm} \cdot \epsilon_{\pm} = 0$ \JK{Is this only true in Coulomb gauge?} allows us to decompose $\epsilon^\mu$ into an outer product of two vectors. To this end, we introduce a reference vector $q^\mu$ and write:
\begin{align} \label{eq:pols}
    \epsilon^\mu_{-}(p, q) = \frac{\bra{p}\gamma^\mu\ketsq{q}}{\sqrt{2}\braketsq{qp}} && \epsilon^\mu_{+}(p, q) = \frac{\bra{q}\gamma^\mu\ketsq{p}}{\sqrt{2}\braket{qp}} \,.
\end{align}
The choice of the reference vector is arbitrary (apart from the condition $q^\mu \neq p^\mu$), which reflects gauge invariance. In practice, it is useful to choose it such that contracting $\epsilon^\mu$ leads to the formation of vanishing spinor brackets, thus greatly simplifying the algebra. The validity of Eq.~\ref{eq:pols} can be verified by observing that these expressions obey all identities we would expect from a polarisation vector \JK{I don't like this}:
\begin{align}
    p \cdot \epsilon_\pm(p, q) &= 0 \\
    q \cdot \epsilon_\pm(p, q) &= 0 \\
    \epsilon_\pm (p, q) \cdot \epsilon_\pm(p', q) &= 0 \\
    \epsilon_\pm (p, q) \cdot \epsilon_\mp(p', p) &= 0 \\
    \epsilon_\pm^\ast (p, q) \cdot \epsilon_\pm(p, q) &= -1
\end{align}

At this point, we have all the tools we need to express any amplitude of massless fermions and spin\=/1 bosons through the angle and square brackets. Its usefulness, however, may not be immediately clear, especially given the notation which at first appears daunting. As a quick demonstration of the power of spinor-helicity formalism, let us consider the special case of 3-particle kinematics. For any three massless momenta satisfying $p_1^\mu + p_2^\mu + p_3^\mu = 0$, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \braket{12}\braketsq{21} = s_{12} = p_3^2 = 0\,.
\end{equation}
Thus, either $\braket{12} = 0$ or $\braketsq{12} = 0$. If we assume $\braket{12}$ is non-vanishing, then by momentum conservation and the massless Weyl equation:
\begin{equation}
    \braket{12}\braketsq{23} = \langle 1|\slashed{2}|\ket{3} = -\langle 1|(\slashed{1}+\slashed{3})\ket{3} = 0\,.
\end{equation}
Thus, $\braketsq{23} = 0$ and in an analogous manner, we can show that $\braketsq{13} = 0$ as well. Had we assumed $\braketsq{12} \neq 0$, we would have found that all angle brackets vanish instead:
\begin{equation}
    \braketsq{12} = \braketsq{13} = \braketsq{23} = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad \braket{12} = \braket{13} = \braket{23} = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
Therefore, for 3-particle kinematics, the amplitude must depend on either square or angle brackets only. However, note that this result makes sense only if we work with complex momenta. Otherwise, through Eq.~\ref{eq:complexconjbracket}, the angle and square brackets are complex conjugates of each other and so both types must vanish simultaneously. Amplitudes constructed from complex momenta are of course not physical, nonetheless they provide a useful building block for higher-point amplitudes in recursive techniques \JK{reference to BCFW? Maybe I should have a mini-section on BCFW when talking about the tree amps for $\ppbbh$}.
